# Demo Repo - Python LLM API Wrapper Service

This is a demo of a robust Python-based LLM API wrapper service that integrates multiple providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI), implements fallback mechanisms for enhanced reliability, and delivers diverse endpoints for tasks such as generating email responses, rewriting messages, and summarizing text. The service is designed to be highly configurable, with support for custom tool configurations and precise cost accounting.

## Install

```bash
python3 -mvenv ./.venv
./.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Format / Lint Check

```bash
./.venv/bin/ruff  format
15 files left unchanged

./.venv/bin/ruff  check
All checks passed!
```

## Set API keys

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values for your API
keys. Currently OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI are supported.

## Start dev server

```bash
./.venv/bin/python3 run.py
```

## Start server with Gunicorn, use this for prod deployment behind nginx

```bash
./.venv/bin/gunicorn --config gunicorn.conf.py
```

## Using the API, Examples

### Email Response Generation

Generate a response to an email, using the Anthropic API w/the default model:

```bash
curl --include --header 'Content-type: application/json' --request POST \
 --data '{"email": "Hello, how are you? Please respond with your earliest availability"}' \
 http://localhost:6000/anthropic/email

```

### Text Summarization

Summarize a text using the OpenAI API w/a specific model:

```bash
curl --include --header 'Content-type: application/json' --request POST \
 --data '{"text": "Johannes Gutenberg (1398 â€“ 1468) was a German goldsmith and publisher who introduced printing to Europe. His introduction of mechanical movable type printing to Europe started the Printing Revolution and is widely regarded as the most important event of the modern period. It played a key role in the scientific revolution and laid the basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses", "model": "gpt-4-turbo"}' \

```

### Professional Message Rewrite

Rewrite a message:

```bash
curl --include --header 'Content-type: application/json' --request POST \
 --data '{"message": "Yo dawg! :D I need a job pretty bad, you got any leads for a good gig?"}' \
 http://localhost:6000/openai/rewrite

```

### Basic Prompt Passthru

Write any prompt, in this case request a haiku about tea and Unix, using the Claude 3 Haiku model

```bash
curl --include --header 'Content-type: application/json' --request POST \
 --data '{"message": "Write me a haiku about tea and unix", "model": "claude-3-haiku-20240307"}' \
